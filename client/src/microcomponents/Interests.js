      <p className='personal-interests-para'>I love music, especially playing the harp and musical theatre. I was heavily involved in choirs whilst at school, and founded and directed my own a cappella group whilst at university. I have played the harp since the age of 7 and still regularly play for my own amusement. I have previously performed alongside a choir, solo soprano and orchestras whilst at school and university.</p>
