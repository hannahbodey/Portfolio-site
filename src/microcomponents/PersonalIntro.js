      <h4 className='personal-intro'>About me</h4>
      <p className='personal-intro-para'>Having seen first-hand some of the frustrations encountered by teachers in todayâ€™s society, I would love to be able to alleviate these as much as possible by collaborating on tech projects to support schools. I am passionate about acting to achieve something beyond myself, which motivated me throughout my teaching career. My capacity to support students and colleagues alike was something often noted by others. I go above and beyond to ensure that all those with whom I work can achieve their goals and that work is completed to an excellent standard. I also love learning new languages (computer and human!), and the problem-solving involved in coding. I hope to twin these two interests as I move forward in this new phase of my career in software.</p>
