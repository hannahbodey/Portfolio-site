          <p className='project-description'>I spent just over a week building a Medieval version of the arcade classic PacMan. I studied a lot of Medieval literature at university and knew that the manuscripts have some excellent margin drawings of monsters, and this was the inspiration for my theme. I drafted up the logic in pseudocode, built my MVP functioning and then built up the styling. Once that was done, I worked on the movement of the ghosts - I especially wanted to capture the original characters of the ghosts, which are all different. I employed multiple rules on the movement of these ghosts to give them different characters.</p>
