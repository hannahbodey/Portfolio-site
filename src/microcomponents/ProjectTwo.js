          <p className='project-description'>In 48 hours with a partner, I built a React.js app that consumed the Merriam Webster dictionary APIs to return definitions. I went for a clean and simple design that put the emphasis on the definitions. The API structure was quite complex, so it took us a long time to get the information showing correctly. We did manage this, however, and managed to produce this functioning product in a very short period of time. I particularly built the home page with its random word-of-the-day feature in order to provide an introductory stage for the user.</p>
